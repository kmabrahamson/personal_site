<p>Hi, I'm Kaitlin, a full stack web developer and escapee from academia. Turns out abstract thought, dense scholarship, and relentless communication are a pretty good foundation for thinking in if/else, working with piecemeal documentation, and getting my point across over Slack. I'm an American expat based in the Vancouver, B.C. area with experience working remotely.</p>

<p>My current love is Ruby, but I've been known to get up and running with a framework or language just because it sounded interesting. You've probably seen me around the local tech meet-up scene or volunteering for groups like Geek Girl Tech Con and Girl Develop It.</p>
