<p>Hi, I'm Kaitlin, a full stack web developer and former academic. Turns out abstract thought, dense scholarship, and relentless communication are a pretty good foundation for thinking in if/else, working with piecemeal documentation, and getting my point across over Slack. I'm based in the Boston area with experience working remotely.</p>

<p>My current love is Ruby and the back end is my happy place, but I've been known to get up and running with a framework or language just because it sounded interesting. In particular I've spent the last few years in and around the med/health tech space, and I'd love to chat about the challenges of HIPAA compliant pipelines, integration and EHR bingo, or front ends that are functional while still being stylish.</p>
