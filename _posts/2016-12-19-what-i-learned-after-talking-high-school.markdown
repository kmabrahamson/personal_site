description: what i learned after talking about web development to a room of fifteen-year-olds

It was Computer Science Education Week recently (who knew, right?) and I was asked to give a talk about being a web developer.  Awesome, sure, I love giving talks. Even better, I'd be giving it with the fantastic [Lea Ann Bradford](http://www.leaannbradford.com){:target="_blank"} -- go take a look at her awesome front-end work.

Our audience: a room of high school students.

Remembering myself in high school gave me a little pause, but I was still genuinely excited to talk about the field for a group of teens presumably interested in the material.  Most of the tech talks I've given by now have been for professional peers or those putting the work in to join the ranks, so this was a very new experience. A few weeks out, here are my thoughts about what worked and what I'd do differently.

# Know Your Audience
I'm so glad I got in touch with the teacher ahead of time to get a sense of the curriculum and where the students were in the syllabus.  I was able to gear my talk towards the concerns of front-end development and knew not to drop a bunch of technobabble that wouldn't mean anything to a bunch of kids who'd been working with Photoshop, HTML and CSS coming later in the course.  I ended up giving a talk that covered a lot about Agile, client communication, wire-framing, and other concepts that they could relate with their project-based coursework.

# Make It Interactive
I do wish I'd had some kind of activity for them to get things started with a bit more energy, and I have one in mind for if I ever do this kind of talk again. As it was, it was a shy class, so drawing them in with "What do you think...?" and "Have you ever...?" questions worked well to keep them engaged and attentive during an early class.

# However You Do It, Just Show Up
Seriously, just go. Everyone laments the pipeline, but students aren't going to think about going into STEM if someone doesn't suggest it to them first. Tell them what the hell a web developer does and that you don't need to be Zuckerberg smart in order to be decent at it. They can even work at companies other than Facebook and Google! A lot of kids get weird ideas about how they're terrible at math or science based on a B+, sometimes without enough pushback from the adults around them (*waves hand*), so we need to be visible in talking about how freaking cool these careers are AND that it's not dark magic.  We can take the ego hit.
